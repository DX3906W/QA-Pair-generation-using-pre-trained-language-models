Generated answers:  ["Phosphor-based LED efficiency losses are due to the heat loss from the Stokes shift and also other phosphor-related degradation issues. Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficaacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficaacy of an original blue LED because of the human eye's  sensitivity to blue and white green (lows based on the lightnosity ratio). Due to the nature of light, phosphor light is considered considered most efficient method for producing high-intensity LED LEDs. The use of selection of a source source for  source using phospho monochrome LEDter using phosphor light is much and easier than a conventional LED lamp, and the majority of high-intensity LED LEDs presently on the market are powered with phosphor conversion sources.", 'Theal architecture refers to the period when much of the Indian subcontinent was eroded with the Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 CE).
